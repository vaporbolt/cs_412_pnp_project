THIS IS THE README FOR THE EXACT SOLUTION

Running run_test_cases.sh will run test cases up to our 13 vertex test case (which takes around 10 minutes to run),
stored in the test_cases folder in the exact solution directory. It will run each test case once, outputting results
to the file named output.txt. For our testing, we used git bash to run this since we are both on windows and running
shell scripts can be a pain on Windows.
**Timing code is commented out, to enable it uncomment the final print statement in main of travelling_sales_exact.py

In bash, navigating to the exact_solution directory and running
$sh run_test_cases.sh will run the test cases and output the results to a text file called output.
